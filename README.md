## 📄 Pages & UI Philosophy

### 🏠 Home (index.html)  
Welcomes users with bold branding and clean layout. Acts as a gateway to all content. The design uses visual hierarchy to guide attention.

### 🛍️ Products (product.html)  
Displays a catalog of hand-picked men’s lifestyle items. A **white background** is used intentionally to communicate trust and clarity.

### 🔎 Product Detail (product-detail.html)  
Offers in-depth visuals, descriptions, and styling ideas. We use **dark coffee and black tones** to create a luxurious, premium feel.

### 📨 Feedback (feedback.html)  
Simple and centered form layout encourages user interaction. Colors are neutral, focusing on ease of communication.

### 🔐 Login (login.html)  
Clean, intuitive login/registration interface. Designed for familiarity and ease of use.

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Clean & Minimal:** Avoid clutter, maximize focus  
- **Masculine Colors:** Black, brown, grey tones for a modern aesthetic  
- **Responsive First:** Works flawlessly on all screen sizes  
- **User-Centered:** Every choice is guided by clarity and comfort

## 🎨 We applied the following psychological and experience-based principles while gathering requirements and designing the UI:

- **Visibility:** Key UI elements such as menus, buttons, and content blocks are clearly visible and accessible.
- **Affordance:** Interactive elements look and behave like users expect (e.g., buttons have proper visual cues and hover effects).
- **Feedback:** Users receive visual responses when they interact with components (hover effects, clickable cards, etc.).
- **Consistency:** Design patterns, colors, and layouts are consistent across all pages.
- **Recognition over Recall:** The site uses standard navigation and familiar interface structures to reduce cognitive load.
- **Cognitive Load:** Pages are clean and minimal, helping users focus on important content without distraction.
